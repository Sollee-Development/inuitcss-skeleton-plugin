# inuitcss-skeleton-plugin
A plugin to give default skeleton styling to inuitcss

## Differences between this and Skeleton
* It does not include the skeleton grid system in order to favor the inuit grid system because this is a plugin for inuitcss
* This uses the default example button component for inuit but rewritten to allow setting your own values for the colors. To make a button look like a skeleton button use the modifier `.c-btm--skel`.
