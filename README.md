# inuitcss-skeleton-plugin
A plugin to give default skeleton styling to inuitcss

## Differences between this and Skeleton
* It does not include the skeleton grid system in order to favor the inuit grid system because this is a plugin for inuitcss
* This uses the default example button component for inuit but rewritten to allow setting your own values for the colors. To make a button look like a skeleton button use the modifier `.c-btn--skel`.
    * To get the same formatting as the button class in skeleton use `class="c-btn c-btn--skel c-btn--secondary c-btn--ghost"`
    It seems like a lot of classes for a commonly used style so please create an issue if you would like to see this 
    changed because if there is enough support then I will change it
